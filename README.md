## Manual

Until this app is feature complete, you can use other clients to access you notes inside your `Notes` folder (mailbox) on your IMAP server. I highly recommend [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), whose web and mobile clients have nice, dedicated support for notes inside a Notes folder.
